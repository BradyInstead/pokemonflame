In this code review task, you're expected to refactor the provided code snippet to adhere to high coding standards and best practices. The code currently has a basic structure that fetches data from an API, processes it, and displays it on the UI. However, it requires some improvements to ensure it is robust, readable, and maintainable. Your goal is to enhance this code snippet, ensuring it adheres to the best coding practices, SOLID code standards and is well-organized, and error-tolerant.

Here are some key areas to focus on:

- **Modularization and Separation of Concerns**: Ensure that the code is well-organized with a clear separation of concerns among different functionalities.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is crucial, especially during network requests and file operations to provide a smooth user experience.
- **Input Validation**: Validate user inputs to ensure they are correct before proceeding with any operations.
- **Networking**: Ensure the network requests are handled properly, catering to different states like success, failure, or timeouts.
- **Code Conventions and Naming**: Adopt a consistent naming convention and make sure method names and variables are descriptive.
- **UI Updating**: Efficient and clear updating of the UI is crucial for a good user experience. Ensure that the UI updates are done in a manner that is easy to understand and maintain.

Please take your time to go through the code, identify areas of improvement, and refactor it accordingly to meet the highest coding standards. We're looking forward to reviewing your optimized and well-structured code.
